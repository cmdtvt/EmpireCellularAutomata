Rules for Empire cellural automata

Each cell is part of a colony.
Each cell has these variables
    - Strenght
    - Age
    - Reproduction value (0-100%)
    - Alive

When reproduction value treshold is met cell spawns new cell
which has same values as parent. These values can mutate meaning they can be little higher or lower.

If two cells from different colonies meet eachother the one with lower strenght value dies.

Each simulation Age value is rised by 1.
If age exceeds strnght cell dies
